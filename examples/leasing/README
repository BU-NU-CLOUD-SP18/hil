Leasing scripts is used to free a node 
from a specific project after a certain amount of time.

The procedure is as follows: 
Cron job will call the leasing script in pre-defined time 
intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds). Leasing script checks
node's status in the status file and updates the number 
of times cron job is called the leasing script while the node 
has been asigned to the project. 
If this number of times passes the threshold, then the node 
will be freed. 
So, threshould * cron_job_interval = the time that the node 
will be released. For example, if threshold is 5 and intervals
are set to 1 minutes, then after 5*1 = 5 minutes, the node will 
be released.

One can change the assigned time for all nodes (by chanigng threshold
in config file) or for one node (by changing the line in the 
status file related to the node.)

Script reads a config file from /etc/leasing.cfg
which defines which nodes are in the project, time threshold
admin user name and password and status file.

status file includes each node's status, which node is in
which project, and which node is free and for how long the node
has been assigned to the project.

Config file format (/etc/leasing.cfg):
node_list: names of the nodes
threshold: number of times that cron job should call the leasing 
script before releasing the node
user_name:
password:
endpoint: the ip address and the port number
            which hil is running on
status_file: the path to the status file (e.g., /var/lib/leasing)
